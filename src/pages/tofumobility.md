TOFU_MOBILITY is a mobile application for iPhone designed to manage the flow of public transport fleets. The application allows real-time control of drivers and their routes, notifying them of any issues or required changes to optimize traffic flow. Passengers can view the nearest transport to their stop, the vehicle's status, the driver on board, whether the transport is energy sustainable, if it is suitable for people with disabilities, and the availability of seats. Both drivers and users can report any route problems, such as road issues or incidents. Fleet managers can monitor the status of vehicles and stops in real time to understand transport demand and availability.
